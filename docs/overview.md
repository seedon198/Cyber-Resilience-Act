# EU Cyber Resilience Act - Overview

## What is the Cyber Resilience Act?

The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is landmark cybersecurity legislation that establishes mandatory cybersecurity requirements for digital products with connectivity features. Adopted by the European Parliament and Council, the CRA aims to ensure that hardware and software products are secure by design and remain secure throughout their lifecycle.

## Scope and Applicability

### Products Covered by CRA

**Hardware Products:**
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- Industrial control systems and components
- Automotive electronic control units (ECUs)
- Medical devices with digital elements
- Consumer electronics with network connectivity
- Smart home appliances and security systems

**Software Products:**
- Operating systems and firmware
- Embedded software in hardware products
- Network and security software
- Industrial automation software
- Remote access and management tools

### Products Exempt from CRA

- Products primarily regulated by sector-specific EU legislation (aviation, automotive safety, medical devices for specific uses)
- Products without digital elements or connectivity
- Free and open-source software (with specific conditions)
- Products developed for internal use only

## Key Regulatory Requirements

### Essential Cybersecurity Requirements

1. **Secure by Design**
   - Products must be designed, developed, and produced with cybersecurity as a fundamental consideration
   - Risk assessment and mitigation throughout the product lifecycle

2. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Mandatory vulnerability disclosure and handling processes
   - Timely security updates and patches
   - End-of-life security support commitments

3. **Incident Response**
   - Reporting of actively exploited vulnerabilities to ENISA
   - Coordination with relevant authorities for incident response

4. **Documentation and Transparency**
   - Clear cybersecurity documentation for users
   - Instructions for secure installation, configuration, and use
   - Regular security assessments and audits

### Risk Classifications

**Class I (Default Risk)**
- Most digital products with cybersecurity implications
- Self-assessment against essential requirements
- CE marking with conformity declaration

**Class II (Higher Risk)**
- Products with significant cybersecurity implications
- Third-party assessment required
- Notified body involvement in conformity assessment

**Critical Products (Highest Risk)**
- Products critical to public security, safety, or fundamental rights
- Enhanced oversight and assessment requirements
- Includes specific ICS/SCADA components and critical infrastructure systems

## Enforcement Timeline

### Key Dates

- **Regulation Entry into Force:** August 2024
- **Preparatory Phase:** August 2024 - August 2027
- **Full Enforcement:** August 11, 2027
- **Voluntary Compliance Period:** Immediate implementation encouraged

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1 (2024-2025): Preparation**
- Development of implementing acts and standards
- Industry guidance and consultation processes
- Notified body designation and accreditation

**Phase 2 (2025-2027): Transition**
- Industry adaptation and implementation
- Training and certification program development
- Market surveillance authority preparation

**Phase 3 (2027+): Full Enforcement**
- Mandatory compliance for all in-scope products
- Market surveillance and enforcement activities
- Penalties for non-compliance

## Geographic and Market Impact

### Territorial Scope
- Applies to all products placed on the EU market
- Includes products manufactured outside the EU but sold within the EU
- Extraterritorial effects similar to GDPR

### Economic Operators Responsibilities

**Manufacturers:**
- Primary responsibility for CRA compliance
- Risk assessment and conformity assessment
- Technical documentation and CE marking

**Importers:**
- Ensure manufacturer compliance before import
- Verify CE marking and documentation
- Market surveillance cooperation

**Distributors:**
- Verify CE marking before distribution
- Cease distribution of non-compliant products
- Inform authorities of non-compliance

## Relationship to Other Regulations

### Complementary EU Legislation
- **NIS2 Directive:** Network and information security
- **Machinery Regulation:** Safety of machinery with digital elements
- **Radio Equipment Directive:** Radio equipment cybersecurity
- **Medical Device Regulation:** Medical device cybersecurity

### International Alignment
- Coordination with international cybersecurity standards (ISO 27001, IEC 62443)
- Alignment with existing industry best practices
- Mutual recognition discussions with other jurisdictions

## Industry-Specific Considerations

### Industrial Control Systems
- Special requirements for ICS components
- Integration with operational technology (OT) security frameworks
- Critical infrastructure protection considerations

### Automotive Sector
- Coordination with UN-ECE WP.29 cybersecurity regulations
- Vehicle cybersecurity management systems
- Over-the-air update security requirements

### Consumer IoT
- Privacy and data protection considerations
- User-friendly security features and notifications
- Interoperability and ecosystem security
